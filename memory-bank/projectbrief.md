# Project Brief: EspressoX

## Overview
EspressoX is a TypeScript-based cross-chain bridge and swap platform built on top of the ElizaOS framework. It facilitates token transfers and swaps across different blockchain networks with a focus on Arbitrum, Base, and other EVM-compatible chains.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Cross-chain token bridging
   - Support for ETH and stablecoins (USDC, USDT)
   - Multiple chain support (Arbitrum, Base, etc.)
   - Transaction validation and error handling

2. Wallet Integration
   - Secure wallet provider implementation
   - Address management and validation
   - Chain-specific configurations

3. Action System
   - Bridge action for cross-chain transfers
   - Swap functionality
   - Transfer capabilities

### Technical Requirements
1. Architecture
   - TypeScript/Node.js based implementation
   - Modular action system
   - Template-driven interactions

2. Integration Requirements
   - Relay SDK integration for routing
   - ElizaOS framework compatibility
   - Multi-chain support

3. Performance & Security
   - Robust error handling
   - Transaction validation
   - Secure wallet management

## Project Goals
1. Provide seamless cross-chain token transfers
2. Enable efficient token swaps
3. Maintain high security standards
4. Ensure reliable transaction processing
5. Support multiple EVM-compatible chains

## Scope
- Implementation of core bridging functionality
- Support for major tokens (ETH, USDC, USDT)
- Integration with popular EVM chains
- Wallet management and security
- Transaction monitoring and validation

## Constraints
- Node.js version >=22 requirement
- EVM-compatible chains only
- Dependent on Relay SDK for routing
- ElizaOS framework limitations

## Success Criteria
1. Successful cross-chain token transfers
2. Reliable transaction processing
3. Proper error handling and user feedback
4. Secure wallet operations
5. Efficient route finding and execution
